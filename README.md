# Gilded Rose Refactoring Kata

This Kata was originally created by Terry Hughes (http://twitter.com/TerryHughes). It is already on GitHub [here](https://github.com/NotMyself/GildedRose). See also [Bobby Johnson's description of the kata](http://iamnotmyself.com/2011/02/13/refactor-this-the-gilded-rose-kata/).

Emily Bache translated the original C# into a [few other languages](https://github.com/emilybache/GildedRose-Refactoring-Kata), (with a little help from my friends!), and slightly changed the starting position. She also wrote this article ["Writing Good Tests for the Gilded Rose Kata"](http://coding-is-like-cooking.info/2013/03/writing-good-tests-for-the-gilded-rose-kata/) about how you could use this kata in a [coding dojo](https://leanpub.com/codingdojohandbook).

More and detailed information on the original [github project](https://github.com/emilybache/GildedRose-Refactoring-Kata)

This repository contains a Java-only version of the kata. This build is based on gradle and has a few more libraries (e.g. junit5, approval test and pitest) as dependencies.
